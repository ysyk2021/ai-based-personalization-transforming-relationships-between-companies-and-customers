In this book, we have explored the growing importance of AI-based personalization in transforming the relationships between companies and customers. We have discussed the benefits and challenges of personalization, the key drivers and enablers of AI-based personalization, and the best practices and strategies for designing and implementing personalized experiences that meet customer needs and preferences.

We started by defining personalization and discussing its various forms, such as product personalization, content personalization, and experience personalization. We then explored the role of AI in enabling scalable, real-time, and context-driven personalization and the various AI techniques and tools that companies can use to create personalized experiences.

We also discussed the ethical and privacy considerations of personalization and the need for transparent and responsible data governance practices to ensure customer trust and consent.
