### Sources of Transactional Data:

Transactional data can be obtained from various sources, including:

* **E-commerce Platforms**: Extracting data from e-commerce platforms, point-of-sale systems, or online marketplaces.
* **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems**: Integrating CRM systems to capture and store transactional data associated with customer interactions.
* **Payment Gateways**: Accessing data from payment gateways that process financial transactions, providing insights into purchase details and order history.
