Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy that involves adjusting prices based on real-time market conditions or customer behavior. This technique uses AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze data such as sales history, demand, and competitor pricing to determine optimal prices for products or services.

Dynamic pricing can be used to offer personalized pricing to different customer segments, such as loyalty program members or first-time buyers. It can also be used to incentivize customers to purchase higher-margin products or to balance inventory levels.

Product Customization

Product customization involves offering customers the ability to personalize products or services according to their preferences and needs. This technique uses AI and machine learning to analyze customer data such as purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information to provide personalized recommendations and options.

Product customization can be used to increase customer engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized products that meet individual needs and preferences. It can also be used to increase sales by offering additional features and upgrades that are tailored to each customer's needs.
